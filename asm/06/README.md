# Simple library in C to make socket easier

Nah, just joking. There are thousands of libraries like this. I just wanted to know how to make a `.so` shared library.

## Building and running

```
make all
sudo make install
```

Sorry, only working on Linux at the moment.

**NOT PLANNING** on adding W\*ndows support. The `dll` and `$PATH` ecosystem is just too complicated for me.
